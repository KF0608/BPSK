  - Laplacian: P_b = (1/2)exp(-√(2E_b/N₀))
- Statistical verification of Laplacian distribution (PDF/CDF)

**Outputs:**
- BER performance comparison plot

2. Laplacian noise
3. Rayleigh fading + AWGN (fixed distance d=1m)
4. Rayleigh fading + AWGN + random deployment

## Key Technical Implementations

### Laplacian Random Number Generation
Using inverse transform method to generate Laplacian distributed random numbers:
```matlab
function r = laprnd(m,n,mu,b)
    U = rand(m,n) - 0.5;
    r = mu - b * sign(U) .* log(1 - 2*abs(U));
end
```

### Stable Marcum Q-Function (Level 5)
Numerically stable implementation to avoid overflow issues:
```matlab
function q = MarcumQ1_stable(a, b)
    integrand = @(t) t .* besseli(0, a.*t, 1) .* exp(-(t-a).^2 / 2);
    q = integral(integrand, b, inf);
end
```

### Random Deployment Modeling (Level 5)
Uniform random deployment within circular area:
```matlab
dRand = R*sqrt(rand(N,1));           % Uniform in circular area
path_loss = dRand.^alpha;            % Path-loss with exponent α
effective_snr = g_lin * |h|² / path_loss;  % Effective SNR
```

## Performance Metrics

### BER Analysis
- **Simulation Method**: Monte Carlo with hard decision detection
- **Theoretical Formulas**: Verified against established communication theory
- **SNR Range**: 0 to 15 dB (E_b/N₀)

### Outage Probability (Level 5)
- **Threshold**: γ_th = 2^C - 1 where C = 1.2 bps/Hz
- **Analysis**: Both fixed distance and random deployment scenarios
- **Integration**: Analytical calculation with numerical verification

## Expected Results

### Channel Performance Ranking (Best to Worst BER)
1. AWGN
2. Rician fading (fixed distance)
3. Laplacian noise
4. Rayleigh fading (fixed distance)
5. Rician fading (random deployment)
6. Rayleigh fading (random deployment)

### Key Observations
- Random deployment significantly degrades performance due to path-loss
- Rician channels outperform Rayleigh due to line-of-sight component
- Laplacian noise shows exponential BER decay
- Outage probability increases with random deployment

## Validation and Accuracy

### Statistical Validation
- **Level 2**: Large sample size (10⁷ bits) ensures high accuracy
- **Level 5**: Monte Carlo error O(1/√N) with N = 10⁶
- **Theory Matching**: Simulation results validate analytical formulas

### Numerical Stability
- Robust implementations prevent overflow/underflow
- Stable integration algorithms for complex scenarios
- Error handling for edge cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Memory Limitations**: Reduce sample size or process sequentially
2. **Long Runtime**: Consider parallel processing
3. **Integration Convergence**: Adjust tolerance parameters
4. **Figure Display**: Ensure graphics drivers are updated
